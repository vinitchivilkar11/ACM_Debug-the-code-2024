# Divide Two Integers

## Problem Statement
Given two integers ```dividend``` and ```divisor``` , divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example,``` 8.345 ``` would be truncated to ```8```, and ```-2.7335``` would be truncated to ```-2```.

Return the quotient after dividing ```dividend``` by ```divisor```.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range:``` [−2³¹, 2³¹ − 1]```. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than ```2³¹- 1```, then return ```2³¹ - 1```, and if the quotient is strictly less than ```-2³¹```, then return ```-2³¹```.

### Example 1:

**Input**:   
```
dividend = 10, divisor = 3
```  
**Output**:  
```
4
```  
**Explanation**: ```10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.```
### Example 2:

**Input**:  
```
dividend = 7, divisor = -3
```  
**Output**:  
```
-2
```  
**Explanation**: ```7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.```


## Constraints:

- ```-2³¹ <= dividend, divisor <= 2³¹ - 1```
- ```divisor != 0```

## Buggy Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) 
    {
        if( dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == 0 )
            return INT_MIN;

        int ans = dividend * divisor;

        if(ans < 0)
            return INT_MIN;

        if(ans == INT_MAX)
            return INT_MIN;

        return dividend;
    }
};

```
